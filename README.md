"The War" is a simu-turn tactical war game. It aims to combine the feel of a tabletop wargame with the accessibility of a modern RTS game. Complex mechanics like damage rolls, line-of-sight and modifiers will be safely transparent to new players, while remaining accessible to the more hardcore type of players.

The game will either take place during a historical war setting like WWII or provide an alternate history to spice things up. The goal of picking the setting will be to allow a particular flavor of cover-based, supress and flank tactics.
